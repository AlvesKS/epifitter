# *epifitter*: Analysis and simulation of plant disease progress curves <img width = 200px align = right src="man/figures/logo.png" />

## Introduction

The `epifitter` package was designed to provide a set of tools for basic analysis of plant disease progress curve such as model fitting and simulating data for scientific or teaching porpuses.

Analyses of plant disease progress curve (DPC) data, mainly for the description, comparison, and prediction, involves fitting of population dynamics models to data, extracting variables from the curves, or generating curves using simulation models. The mathematics behind is relatively simple and general-purpose statistical software can be used to perform the calculations. 

The `epifitter` is a user-friendly R package for conducting all sorts of analysis of plant disease progress data.

Have fun!
